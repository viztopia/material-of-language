# A Computational Approaches to Chinese Typefaces
This is a repo of a project co-created by me & Henry Haoyu Wang. It is our final project for Allison Parrish's Material of Language class at ITP, Spring 2020, and it's an ML experiment about styling generated Chinese typefaces with custom images.   

In this project, we made a waterfall glyph composition using a Tang Dynasty poem written by Li Bai, a famouse ancient Chinese poet. The peom, titled "望庐山瀑布" (which means watching "望" the water fall"瀑布" of Mount. Lu"庐山") describes the magnificent scene of a waterfall in southern China, and it is acclaimed for the wild imagination & vivid motion depiction about the waterfall.

This project utilized two machine learning models - one called GlyphGAN, the other called ShapeMatchingGAN. We used the GlyphGAN model to generate glyphs of the poem, and then used ShapeMatchingGAN to style the generated composition with a waterfall image.

You can check the notebooks under the GlyphGAN folder first, then check the one under ShapeMatchingGAN.
